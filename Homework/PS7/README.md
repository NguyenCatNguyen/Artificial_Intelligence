```

## Problem 2
- Following your yearly checkup, the doctor shares some bad news and some good news
- The bad news is that you tested positive for a serious disease and that the test is 99% accurate.
- The good news is that this is a rare disease and that only 1 in 10000 people have it.
- Why is it good news that the disease is rare?
- What are the chances that you actually have the disease?
