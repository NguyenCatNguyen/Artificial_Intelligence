## Problem 6.6 
b. 
- I modified on the size of the board to 4x4
- Change the win length to 4
- Modify the `print_out` function to print a 4x4 board.
- Modify the `utility` function to check for 4 in a row.
- Modify the `is_terminal` function to check for a win on a 4x4 board. 
    - Row win
    - Column win
    - Diagonal win
- I change the `move state` to fit with the 4X4 board.
- Modify `next_state` to fit with the 4X4 board.
- This took me about 2 hours to complete.
