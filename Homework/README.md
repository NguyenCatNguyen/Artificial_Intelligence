#### Problem 2.1 [20 points]
For each of the following, give a PEAS description of the task environment -- 
in a grid as in Figure 2.5 of R&N -- and characterize it in terms of the 
properties described in Section 2.3.2 of R&N, putting your answers to the that 
part in a grid as in Figure 2.6 of R&N.

#### Problem 2.2 [10 points]
The discrete photovore we talked about in class had a one-dimensional percept 
with two values: {NoLight, Light}. Thus, using the notation in the middle of 
page 48 of R&N it has |P|=2 (that is, the total number of percepts is two).
