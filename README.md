## Lecture 3: Rational Agents
- `Rational Agent` - "Do the right thing"
- `Agent` is anything that can be viewed as perceiving 
its enviroment through sensors and acting upon that
evinroment through *actuators*.
- `Rational` (correct agent function) depends on
    - 1. Performance Measure (win as chess)
    - 2. Prior Knowledge (rule)
    - 3. Actions(s) available (move)
    - 4. Percept history to date (all the move in the game so far)
    - 5. Memory and physical limitations
    Rational Agent maximize it performance measure and subject to its ability and limitations.
- `Task Environment`
    - Performance Measure
    - Environment
    - Actuators
    - Sensors

- Rational Agent Architecture:
    - Environment(plan) -> Agent  (percept)
    - Agent -> Action
    - Agent -> State
    - Agent -> Performance Measure
### Example: Photovore Robot
- Percepts at time t, [0] or [1] no light or light 
- Actuator at [0] or [1] stay or move
- If light, stay, else move

=> This type of robot  is call  `Stimulus response agent`.
- Condition/action rule
### Different between Percept Space and Percept History.
1. Percept, Binary value time T, 2 posible value.
- Percept History

### Spectrum of Agent 
- Agent can be thought throw two axit
    - Reflexive => Deliberative
    - Tactical => Strategic
- What make action (the )

### Stig mergy 
- Been use by bees, termite, and ants to find food.
- Puck-Pilling robot
    - Rule that they use for this robot:
        - Go straight => Turn at random
- Stigmergy def: work from the product of work. 
- Complexity of behavior due to complexity of environment.
- Table setting at a royal wedding
- QUESTION: How much of your intelligience is due to your environment? Is it due to your environment or your genes?

### Configuration space of agent/system
