## Lecture 3: Rational Agents
- `Rational Agent` - "Do the right thing"
- `Agent` is anything that can be viewed as perceiving 
its enviroment through sensors and acting upon that
evinroment through *actuators*.
- Rational Agent Architecture:
    - Environment(plan) -> Agent  (percept)
    - Agent -> Action
    - Agent -> State
    - Agent -> Performance Measure
### Example: Photovore Robot
- Percepts at time t, [0] or [1] no light or light 
- Actuator at [0] or [1] stay or move
- If light, stay, else move

=> This type of robot  is call  `Stimulus response agent`.
- Condition/action rule
### Different between Percept Space and Percept History.
1. Percept, Binary value time T, 2 posible value.
- Percept History
