# Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach

## Index

### Chapter 1 Introduction
#### 1.1 What is AI?
- `Artificial Intelligence` is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.
- **Turing Test**
    - A computer is said to pass the Turing Test if a human interrogator cannot distinguish between the computer's output and that of a human.
    - Turning test proposed by Alan Turning in 1950.
    - Design which the question "Can machines think?".
    - The test is not a test of intelligence, but rather a test of a machine's ability to simulate intelligence.
    - The computer would need the following capabilities:
        - `Natural language processing` to communicate successfully in a human language.
        - `Knowledge representation` to store and manipulate knowledge.
        - `Automated reasoning` to answer questions and draw new conclusions.
        - `Machine learning` to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.

## Chapter 2 Intelligent Agent
### 2.1 Agents and Enviroments
- An *agent* is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its *enviroment* through *sensors* and acting upon that enviroment through its *actuators*.
    - Environment: everything outside the agent.
    - Sensors: input from the environment.
    - Actuators: output to the environment.







    
### 2.3 The Nature of Enviroment
- `Task Enviroments` is 
- `PEAS` is a description of the task enviroment
    - Performance Measure is the goal of the agent
    - Environment is the enviroment that the agent is in.
    - Actuators is the action that the agent can do.
    - Sensors is the input that the agent can get.
